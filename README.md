# My first day on GitHub 
Today I learned that version control is an essential part of my **career** as _web developer_. 
Some keywords that I should remember for later are: 
- git, 
- GitHub, 
- version control, 
- repository, 
- commit and hash. 

The next 3 months will be a very exciting time, as I will learn new things every day.
